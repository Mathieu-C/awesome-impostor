## [Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

## [Data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## [Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
